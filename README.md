# policy-gradient
A reinforcement learning agent learns to play Pong!

Implementation of the REINFORCE policy gradient algorithm from [Sutton & Barto](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf), as well as a simplified version inspired by [Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/). I built the model and training procedure from scratch in pure NumPy, without reference to any online code.
